# PetrolStation

Version 1.0.0

The application takes the latitude and longitude coordinates of your current location as input in the following format (latitude:longitude) and displays or returns the nearest petrol station.
This application is all about demostrating the knowledge of arrayLists.

### Rationality behind the program
In reality, more especially if you don't have much knowledge of the area you are currently at, such programs are essential to help you figure out the nearest petrol station. You'll only need your current coordinates, although it'll be a great idea for this program to be able to determine the current coordinates instead of the user having to determine the coordinates themselves, but i felt like keeping the program simple enough.

Note: Implementation still in progress.
